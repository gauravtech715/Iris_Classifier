#Iris Classifier using Scikit-learn

Situation:<br>
As part of a machine learning project, I aimed to build a simple yet effective model to classify species of the Iris flower dataset, a classic benchmark in classification problems.<br>

Task:<br>
The goal was to create a supervised learning classifier using the scikit-learn library that could accurately predict the species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on input features such as sepal and petal length and width.<br>

Action:<br>

1.Utilized the load_iris() dataset from sklearn.datasets.<br>
2.Preprocessed the data and split it into training and testing sets.<br>
3.Trained multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree) and compared their accuracy.<br>
4.Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.<br>

Result:<br>
Achieved over 95% accuracy on the test set with the best-performing model. The project demonstrated proficiency in using scikit-learn for model training, evaluation, and visualization, while also enhancing understanding of classification algorithms.<br>
